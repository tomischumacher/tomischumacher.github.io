        <p>My Name is Tomi Schumacher. I am a software professional with over 20 years of experience.</p>

        <p>Currently I work as a Solutions Architect for stratetic accounts on the west coast (US) at
            <a target="_blank" href="https://www.databricks.com">Databricks</a>
            where we help large enterprise clients use the Databricks Data and AI platform on
            the Azure or AWS cloud.
        </p>

        <p>I was born and raised in Zurich Switzerland, where studied Computer Science at the 
            <a target="_blank" href="https://www.ethz.ch/en.html">Swiss Federal Institute of Technology (ETH)</a>.
            I lived and worked in Switzerland until 2000, when I joined an Internet Startup in the US.
            Now I live in in Orange County in Southern California, about half way between Los Angeles and San Diego. 
        </p>

        <p>Software engineering is not only my job, but also my passion. As a lifelong learner and curious person, I enjoy the fast pace of 
            innovation in IT, which makes learning an essential part of every new project.

        <p>In my spare time I enjoy traveling, photography, listening to music and good food. I write 
            pretty regularly (a couple times a year) about my favorite restaurants on yelp:

            </a>.
            I recently started biking again. It turns out, that that there are hills and quiet streets 
            just a few block away from my front door, and my new road bike is a lot of fun.
